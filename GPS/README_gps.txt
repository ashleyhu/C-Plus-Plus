Step 1. Compile and run <gps.cpp> <coord.h> and <coord.cpp>.
Step 2. Program asks user to enter the ID for the first point, and echoes the entered ID.
Step 3. Program asks user to enter the x, y, and z values for the first point, and echos inputted x, y, and z values.
Step 4. Program asks user to enter the accuracy of first point, where A = high accuracy, B = medium accuracy, and C = low accuracy, and echos inputted accuracy.
Step 5. Repeats step 2-4 for second point.
Step 6. Program displays the first and second point in the form (x, y, z).
Step 7. Program displays the spatial distance, planimetric distance, height difference, and azimuth of first and second point.
Step 8. Press any key to dismiss the window.
