Step 1. Compile and run <pointers.cpp>.
Step 2. Program asks user to enter the centre point and radius of the circle (format: x y radius, in positive integers).
Step 3. Program computes the circle's circumference, and keeps track of the address of its respective value.
Step 4. Program outputs the value of the variable circumference and the address of the variable circumference of the circle.
Step 5. The program echos the circle's location in terms of (x,y), the circle's radius, and the address of the circle struct.
