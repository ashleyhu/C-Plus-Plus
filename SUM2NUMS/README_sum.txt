Step 1. Compile and run <sum.cpp>, <sumtwonums.h>, and <sumtwonums.cpp>.
Step 2. Enter the first positive integer number up to 20 digits.
Step 3. Enter the second positive integer number up to 20 digits
Step 4. The program will disregard all leading zeros, and it will ignore all non-integer values (i.e. letters) and only take in integers (0-9). 
Step 5. If the number entered contains more that 20 digits, "Overflow error. Try again" message will be printed. 
Step 6. If a letter 'q' (lowercase) is entered as an input at the end of the number input, the program will exit.
Step 7. The program display the first and second valid integer numbers entered.
Step 8. The program calculates the summation of those two numbers.
Step 9. The program displays the summation calculated.
