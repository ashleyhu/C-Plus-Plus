Step 1. Compile and run <shape.cpp>, <using_shapes.cpp>, and <shape.h>.

Step 2. Program asks user to enter an integer from 1 - 20 for the size of the square's side length and the type of the shape (0 = hollow, 1 = filled). Program continues to ask until a valid input for both is entered.

Step 3. Program asks user to enter an odd integer from 1 - 19 for the rows of the diamond and the type of the shape (0 = hollow, 1 = filled). Program continues to ask until a valid input for both is entered.

Step 4. Program asks user to enter an odd integer from 1 - 19 for the size of the pyramid base and the type of the shape (0 = hollow, 1 = filled). Program continues to ask until a valid input for both is entered.

Step 5. Program asks user to enter an integer from 1 - 20 for the size of the triangle base and the type of the shape (0 = hollow, 1 = filled). Program continues to ask until a valid input for both is entered.

Step 6. The 4 shapes are outputted into the text file output.txt.
